The architecture of this app is Clean architecture with MVVM. 
It uses live data with data binding to comunicate the view with the view model.
It uses rxJava to comunicate the view model with the use cases and the repositories.
It also uses jetpack navigation and view model from the architecture components.
Finally, it uses Dagger 2 for dependency injection.
